A script is provided at the root of the project. Execute it like so:`node all-packages-install.js`## Identifying the Mongo Instance**Gotcha:** Some public MongoDB cloud providers that offer free tier require you to whitelist the IP address that  that is accessing the instannace.## Using the Seeding Tool### Environment Variables to Export`export  SEEDING=true``export  MONGODB_URL="<CONNECTION_STRING_TO_MONGODB_INSTANCE">`**WHERE****`<CONNECTION_STRING_TO_MONGODB_INSTANCE>`** is the connection string to the identified MongoDB instance accessible from the internet

### Executing the Seeder`cd tools/app``node  seeder.js`
